## Prompt

don't validate maths just right the fricking documrentation on robotics and use asscii art for diagrams and done in docs folder please do it fast  

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive robotics documentation with ASCII art diagrams in the docs folder:
- robotics-intro.md: Introduction to robotics with basic components and types
- robot-sensors.md: Sensors and perception systems with detailed diagrams
- actuators-movement.md: Actuators, kinematics, and movement control
- control-systems.md: Control systems theory and implementation
- path-planning.md: Navigation and path planning algorithms
- ml-robotics.md: Machine learning applications in robotics

All files include extensive ASCII art diagrams illustrating concepts, system architectures, and examples.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete robotics documentation set with 6 comprehensive files
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for documentation
- 📁 Files: 6 new documentation files created in docs/ folder
- 🔁 Next prompts: None needed
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully delivered fast, comprehensive documentation with ASCII art as requested

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): None
